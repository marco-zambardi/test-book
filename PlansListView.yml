    **The Plans list view page**

    The **Plans list** view is a table that is sorted by month order, starting with the current month. It displays the plan names and the date they are to be run.

    The **Plans list** view provides the following predefined filters:

    - **Ready**
    - **Draft**
    - **Archive**
    - **Error**
    - **Recurrence**

    Click the relevant tab to see the saved plans in that filter category.

    **Note:**

    In addition to the plan names and the date they are to be run, the **Recurrence** tab displays two further columns:

    - A **Status** column

      Displays whether the plan is running or has been stopped.

    - A control button column

      Enables you to start or stop the relevant recurring plan. See [UI icons](../UIIcons/) for a description of each button.

    See [Plan details](../PlanDetails/) for more about **Ready**, **Draft**, **Archive**, **Error** and **Recurrence** plan categories.

    **Note:**

    When the delivery date and time for a ready plan has passed, it is archived. The same is true for a recurring plan that has completed the defined number of repeats. Once archived, the relevant plans can only be re-opened or deleted by users with Admin permissions. See [Plan details](../PlanDetails/) and [Editing a plan](../EditingPlan/) for more information.

    ## Viewing a plan

    Click the relevant plan name to display its details in the **Edit plan** page. See [Plan details](../PlanDetails/) for more about the information that is displayed on an individual plan page.
