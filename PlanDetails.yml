    ![Edit plan page](/images/images/en/guide/EditPlan.png)

    **The Edit plan page**

    The details of a particular plan are displayed in the **Edit plan** page. This page varies slightly depending upon whether:

    - You are viewing a plan in the **Ready**, **Draft**, **Archive**, **Error** or **Recurrence** category
    - It is a **One shot** or a **Repeated** plan

    The page includes the following panels, fields and controls:

    - The plan name

    - The **When** panel, which includes two tabs:

      - One shot:

        - The **Day & hour** and **Time zone** of the plan

      - Repeated:

        - The **Day & hour**, **Time zone** and **Repetition** interval of the plan
        - The **End date** for the recurring plan
        - The **Load recurrences** button

        See [Creating new plans](../CreatingNewPlans/) for more about the **Repeated** tab.

    - The **Who** panel, including:

      - The **Segment** used for the plan

      - The DND policy, if applied

      - An **Advanced options** section

        Click the downwards pointing arrow to the left, to access the **List generation** and **Set contacts number** options. See [Creating new plans](../CreatingNewPlans/) for more details.

    - The **Action** panel, including:

      - The **Consumer** panel, which shows the external target for running the plan

        See [Creating new plans](../CreatingNewPlans/) for more details.

    - A series of buttons at the bottom of the page:

      - **Back to plans list**

        Returns you to the **Plans list** view of the **My plans** page.

      - **Delete**

        Deletes the plan.

        See [Deleting a plan](../DeletingPlans/) for more details.

      **Note:**

      This action cannot be reversed.

      If you are viewing an **Archive** plan, this button only displays if you have Admin permissions.

      - **Download**

        Enables you to download the appropriate list in CSV format. Only displays for **Ready**, **Archive** and **Error** plans, but not if they are recurring.

      **Note**

      The list only includes the contact ID and email address. However, due to the sensitive nature of this information, only users with Admin permissions can download a list.

      - **Reopen**

        Enables you to re-open a plan for editing. Only displays for **Ready** plans, or for **Archive** plans if you have Admin permissions.

        See [Editing a plan](../EditingPlan/) for more details.

      **Note:**

      This action cannot be reversed.

      - **Save As Draft**

        Enables you to save a **Draft** plan for later editing. Only displays for **Draft** and **Error** plans.

        See [Editing a plan](../EditingPlan/) for more details.

      - **Save**

        Enables you to save a **Draft** plan as **Ready**. Only displays for **Draft** and **Error** plans.

    **Note:**

    If you are viewing plans using the **Archive** filter, the above buttons, apart from the **Back to plans list** and the **Download** buttons, are not normally shown. See **Downloading contacts from an Archive plan** below for more details. If you have Admin permissions, the **Delete** and **Reopen** buttons also display.

    ## Draft, Ready, Archive, Error and Recurrence plans

    A **Draft** plan is one that has been created, but is not yet activated as ready. It is a plan that is perhaps not yet complete, or one that has been saved in an unready state for another reason. **Draft** plans can be edited, even if the time and date that it is set to run has passed. See [Editing a plan](../EditingPlan/) for more details.

    A **Ready** plan is a finished plan that has been assigned to be run at a particular time on a selected date. **Ready** plans can be edited up until the time and date that they are due to run. See [Editing a plan](../EditingPlan/) for more details.

    An **Archive** plan is a **Ready** plan that has been run. **Archive** plans can only be re-opened or deleted by users with Admin permissions. See [Editing a plan](../EditingPlan/) for more details.

    An **Error** plan is one that has resulted in an error. For example, a contact list has not been generated, or a campaign has not been created in Contactsend.

    A **Recurrence** plan is one that is set to repeat and end as defined. A **Recurrence** plan can be included in any of the other categories, if it matches the appropriate conditions.

    ### Downloading contacts from an Archive plan

    Do the following:

    1. Click **Archive** in the **Plans list** view.

    2. Locate and click the required plan.

    3. Click **Download**.

      An Explorer window displays.

    4. Navigate to where you want to store the file, and click **Save**.

    5. The file is saved and the Explorer window closes.
