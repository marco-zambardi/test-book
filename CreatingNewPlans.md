# Creating new plans

**Note:**  
See [Data types, input fields and operators](InputBoxOperators.md) for more about the fields and operators that are available in the UI.  

To create a new plan, do the following:

1. Click the **Plans** tab, if not already selected.  
  The **My plans** page displays.  
2. Do one of the following:  
  - In the **Plans list** view or the **Plans calendar** view, click **Create new plan**  
   The **New plan** page displays, and the system automatically generates a plan name, consisting of the words **New plan** and the current date and time.  

     or:  
  - In the **Plans calendar** view:  
    - Use the calendar controls to navigate to the proposed run date for the plan  
      See [Viewing plans](ViewingPlans.md) for more about the calendar controls.  
    - Click the relevant date  
     The **New plan** page displays, and the system automatically generates a plan name, consisting of the words **New plan**, the proposed plan run date and the current time.  
3. Select the system generated name and enter one of your choice.  
  Ensure that the name you use is unique, descriptive of the plan, and can easily be recognized by yourself and others in the future.  
1. In the **Plan details** panel:  
  - Under **Date and time**:
    - Do one of the following:  
      - Enter the date and time of the delivery  
        or:  
      - Click the calendar icon to display the calendar and use its controls to select a date, then enter a time  
    **Note:**  
   If you opened the **New plan** page using the **Create new plan** button, the current date and time are displayed by default. If you opened the **New plan** page by clicking on a date in the **Plans calendar** view, the date you selected and the current time is displayed by default.  
     - Click the downwards pointing arrow to the right of the second box, and select the appropriate time zone, if it needs to be changed  
     **Note:**
    The default time zone is automatically set to the one defined under **Settings** > **Local settings**. See [Local settings](LocalSettings.md) for more details.  

    - Under **Segment**, click the downwards pointing arrow to the right of the box, and select the appropriate segment  
    After a short delay, the number of contacts in the segment displays.  
    - Under **Select DND policy**, click the downwards pointing arrow to the right of the box, and select the appropriate policy, if required  
    After a short delay, the number of relevant contacts displays and the **total contacts** field is adjusted.  

1. In the **Test list** panel, enter the email addresses of any test recipients, if required.  
  The addresses in the list should be separated by commas (,.md).  
2. In the **Consumers** panel, click the downwards pointing arrow to the right of the box, and select the appropriate target platform for running the plan.  
  **Note:**  
  The current release allows you to select the following targets:  
  - ContactLab platform  
    The relevant filters for a delivery using the ContactLab platform are created.  
  - Remote SFTP space  
    The storage location to which the contact list associated with the plan is exported.  
3. When you have finished, do one of the following:  
  - If, for example, your plan is not yet complete, or you think that you may want to change your entries, click **Save as draft**  
  - If you plan is ready, click **Save**  
  - Click **Back to plans list** to abort the process  

  You are returned to the **My plans** page and the draft or ready plan is added to the list.  
  **Note:**  
  You can reopen any plan that has been saved as ready at any time, but you can only edit it up until the time and date that it is due to run. Draft plans can be edited at any time.  

See [Plan details](PlanDetails.md) for more about **Ready** and **Draft** plans.  

**Note:**  
If you later delete a segment or a DND policy, it still continues to be used by any plans to which it has already been applied.
