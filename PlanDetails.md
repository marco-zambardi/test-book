## Draft, ready and archived plans

A **Draft** plan is one that has been created, but is not yet activated as ready. It is a plan that is perhaps not yet complete, or one that has been saved in an unready state for another reason. **Draft** plans can be edited, even if the time and date that it is set to run has passed. See [Editing a plan](EditingPlan.md) for more details.  

A **Ready** plan is a finished plan that has been assigned to be run at a particular time on a selected date. **Ready** plans can be edited up until the time and date that it is due to run. See [Editing a plan](EditingPlan.md) for more details.  
  
An **Archived** plan is a **Ready** plan that has been run. **Archived** plans can no longer be edited.
