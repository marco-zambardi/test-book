    # Analytical queries

    An analytical query enables a comparison to be made between:

    - How often an event occurs that has specific conditions applied to it

      For example, buying a yellow bag, or spending more than 200 euro.

      and:

    - All events of the same kind

      For example, making a purchase.

    **Example:**

    - All those contacts that bought a yellow bag ***on at least 10% of the occasions*** they purchased something

      or:

    - All those contacts that spent more than 200 euro ***on less than 5% of the occasions*** they spent money
