# Creating a purchases rule

*Insert Create purchases rule screen shot...*  

You have four options when creating a purchases rule:

- Use a preset rule  
- Select a preset rule and modify it as required  
- Use a favorite rule  
  Favorite rules are presets that have been saved as you favorites.
- Create a custom rule  

To create a purchases rule:  

1. Click **Create purchases rule** on the **New segment** page  
  The **Create purchases rule** page displays, with **My favorite rules** highlighted and shown by default.  
2. Do one of the following:  
  - Select a favorite  
  - Click **Preset rules**, choose a preset, click **Select** to display the rule, then click **Add** to apply the rule to the segment.  
  - Click **Preset rules**, choose a preset, click **Select** to display the rule, then modify it as required. See [Editing a segment](EditingSegment.md) for more details.  
  **Note:**  
  Remember to change the name of the rule to differentiate it from the preset.  
  - Click **Create custom rule** then follow the instructions given in [Creating a custom purchases rule](CreatingCustomPurchasesRule.md)  
  
  Each time you add a rule, you are returned to the **New segment** page. To close the **Create digital messages rule** page without adding a rule:
  - Click the **X** icon, located in the top right-hand corner of the page  
   or:  
  - Click **Cancel**  
  
3. Repeat the above steps as often as required until you have created all of the purchases rules.  
  **IMPORTANT:**  
  Ensure that you create all rules, including other types of rule such as Demographic rules and Digital messages rules, in the correct order, so that you can apply the appropriate **interaction condition** between pairs of rules. See [Creating new segments](CreatingNewSegments.md) for more about interaction conditions between rules.
