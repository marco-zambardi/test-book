    **The Create custom purchases rule page**

    **Note:**

    See [Using data types, input fields and operators](../InputBoxOperators/) for more about the fields and operators that are available in the UI.

    When you click **Create custom rule**, the **new purchases custom rule** page displays, with the name of the segment shown as its title and **Purchases** highlighted in a small box. The system automatically generates a **Rule name**, consisting of the words **New Purchases** and the time. Do the following:

    1. Select the system generated name and enter one of your choice.

      Ensure that the name you use is unique, descriptive of the rule, and can easily be recognized by yourself and others in the future.

    2. Under **Action**, click the downwards pointing arrow to the right of the box, and select the appropriate purchases action for the rule, for example, **have an order line**.

      **Note:**

      The following purchase actions are available:

      - Have purchased

        Contacts that have made a purchase. The conditions are applied to the whole order.

      - Have not purchased

        Contacts that have not made a purchase. The conditions are applied to the whole order.

      - Have an order line

        Contacts that have made a purchase. The conditions are applied to the order line.

      - Do not have an order line

        Contacts that have not made a purchase. The conditions are applied to the order line.

    3. Under **Time frame**, select when the purchases action should have taken place. Three options are available:

      - **Anytime**

        The action can have taken place at any time. No further options are displayed.

      - **In the date range**

        The action must have taken place:

        - After the first date

          Only the first date field should be completed.

        - Before the second date

          Only the second date field should be completed.

        - Between two dates.

          Both date fields should be completed.

        Click the **Calendar** icon in each box and define the date range.

      - **In the last...**

        The action must have taken place in the defined time period.

          - Enter a numeric value in the first box, for example, **3**
          - Click the downwards pointing arrow to the right of the second box, and select **days**, **weeks**, **months**, or **years**

      See [Time frame conditions](../TimeFrameConditions/) for more about time frames.

    4. Under **Match**, select whether the contacts that are to be identified by the rule, should match **ALL** of the conditions you define in the next steps, or **ANY** of them.

      **Note:**

      If you select **ALL**, the number of relevant contacts in the database, which is displayed to the right of the page at the top and bottom, reduces as each condition is applied. If you select **ANY**, the number of contacts increases. See [Combining conditions within a rule](../CombiningConditionsInRule/) for more details.

    5. Define the conditions that apply to the rule, as follows:

      - The system displays pre-configured purchase conditions, for example:

        - **Order line type**

          The order line category, for example, Return, Regular sale.

        - **Store category**

            The category of the store where the order was made.

      - You can choose to:

        - Apply none, one or any combination of these conditions

          or:

        - Delete them as appropriate, by clicking the **Bin** icon.

        **Note:**

        The conditions that are initially displayed are configured on a customer-by-customer basis, when the system is set up. They can be changed at any time, using the **Segmentation settings** page, which can be accessed through the **Settings** tab in the **Control bar**. See [Segmentation settings](../SegmentationSettings/) for more details.

    6. Add further conditions, if required, as follows:

      - In the **Add condition** panel, click the downwards pointing arrow to the right of the box, and select the appropriate condition, for example, **Store country**, from the drop-down list

      The new condition is added to the list.

      - Click the downwards pointing arrow to the right of the first box, and select the appropriate operator, for example, **Equal to**, from the drop-down list

        **Note:**

        The first box may display a different list of operators, according to the type of condition being defined. See [Operator types](../OperatorTypes/) for more details.

      - Enter the appropriate value in the second box

        **Note:**

        Depending upon the condition that you are defining, the second box may be:

          - [An automated search field](../Autocomplete/)
          - [A free text search field](../FreeText/)
          - [A drop-down list](../MultipleOptions/) or a [drill down enabled list](../DrillDown/)
          - [A date and time field](../Calendar/)
          - [A Relative date field](../RelativeDate/)
          - [A numeric data field](../Number/)
          - [A checkbox](../Checkbox/)

          Date-based input fields allow either:

          - An absolute date to be chosen, using the calendar widget

            or:

          - A relative date to be selected, such as one week ago, or two months in the future

          Click the **opposing horizontal arrows** icon, to the right of the **calendar** or **relative date** field, to change to the other field type. See [UI icons](../UIIcons/) for a description of each icon displayed in the UI.

      - You can delete any condition by clicking the associated **Bin** icon.

    7. When you are finished, do the following:

      - If you want to create a preset from the rule you have defined, click **Save as preset**, before you apply the rule to the segment
      - Click **Add** to apply the rule to the segment, or **Cancel** to abort the process

      You are returned to the **New segment** page and the rule is added to the **Rule list** area of the [Segment Summary panel](../SegmentSummaryPanel/).

    ## % threshold condition

    The **% threshold** condition is used to identify contacts whose activities satisfy a percentage range that is applied to a specific event type, while also meeting the other conditions defined for the rule. For example, contacts who have purchased "ladies shoes" on more than 10% of the occasions that they have made a purchase.

    **Note:**

    The **% threshold** condition can only be applied if at least one other condition is set in addition the **Action** and **Time frame** fields.
