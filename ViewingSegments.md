# Viewing segments

To access the **Segments management** page and view all currently available segments:

  The default **Segments list** view of the **My segments** page displays, showing all currently available segments.

## Segments list view

*Insert Segments list view screen shot...*  

The **Segments list** view is a table that displays the segment names, their creation date and time, their creator and the total number of contacts for each available segment. 

### Sorting the list

The default list view displays the oldest segments first. To sort the list, for example, by the creation date and time, click the double-headed arrow, positioned to the right of the appropriate column.  

**Note:**
If you navigate away from the **Segments** tab and then return, the default list view again displayed.  

### Total contacts

The total number of contacts that are available by applying the rules for a particular segment, varies over time.

To display the current total number of available contacts for a segment:  

- Click the appropriate circular **Reload** icon, positioned in the **Total contacts** column  
  The current total displays after a short delay, while the system applies the rules to the relevant database.  

## Segments cards view

*Insert Segments cards view screen shot...*  

The Segments cards view displays each available segment as an individual card, which includes the segment name, the creation date and time, the creator and the total number of available contacts.  

### Sorting the cards

The cards are sorted in the order that has been applied to the **Segment list** view. If you want the cards to be sorted in a different order:  

- Click the **List** view icon and, for example, click the double-headed arrow to the right of the Created on column  
- Click the **Cards** icon  
  The cards are sorted according to their creation date and time.  

**Note:**
If you navigate away from the **Segments** tab and then return, the **Segments list** view is displayed.  

### Total contacts

To display the current total number of available contacts for a segment:  

- Click the circular **Reload** icon, positioned towards the bottom of the relevant card  
  The current total displays after a short delay, while the system applies the rules to the relevant database.
