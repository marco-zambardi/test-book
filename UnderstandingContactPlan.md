# Understanding contactplan

Contactplan provides you with a range of powerful and readily usable database segmentation and planning tools, which are easy to access through any supported web browser, with no local installation required.  

## Key features and functionality  

Contactplan includes a wide range of features, such as:

- Authentication and access  
  Only authenticated users can access contactplan. In a similar way, the resources a user has access to and the operations they can carry out, is determined by the user profile and access permissions that are assigned to them. For example, some users may not be able to delete or modify resources that have been created by others.  
- An intuitive user interface (UI.md)  
  The UI enables all users, whether they be data specialists, marketing experts or company managers, to retrieve just the target group they require from the database without, for example, knowledge about SQL or the database itself. See [Using the UI](UsingUI.md) for more details.  
- Robust segmentation tools  
  Contactplan enables users to define and freely combine selection conditions, which are then applied to the demographic and behavioral data in the appropriate database, to identify the contacts that make up a segment. The relevant segment can then be used, for example, as the target audience for digital marketing operations. See [Understanding segmentation](UnderstandingSegmentation.md) for more details.  
- Effective planning tools  
  Contactplan enables users to create plans, which define how and when to carry out a specific action on a selected segment. For example, a plan can be used to send an email on Monday, to all those contacts who have bought a product or service over the weekend, thanking them for their purchase. See [Understanding plans](UnderstandingPlans.md) for more details.  
- Segmentation and planning performance analysis  
  Readily available analytical dashboards for any given segment provide clear graphical feedback, which covers a range of key factors. Reports about executed plans include a detailed and very understandable information summary. See [Reports and dashboard analysis](ReportsAndDashboardAnalysis.md) for more details.  
- Native integration with the ContactLab platform  
  Contactplan works seamlessly with the ContactLab platform to create email, SMS and Push deliveries according to the parameters defined by the appropriate plan.  
- Integration with other systems  
  Easy integration with other systems is provided through a REST API. The API can be exploited by any authorized external system for machine-to-machine communication. It can also be used to create custom clients, as an alternative to the UI provided.
