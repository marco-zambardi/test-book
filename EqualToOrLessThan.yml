    # Equal to or less than operator type

    The **Equal to or less than** operator applies to attributes that can be ordered. It is used to select those contacts for which the relevant attribute has a value equal to or less than the one entered in the condition input field.

    **Example:**

    Setting the *Number of children* condition to **Equal to or less than**, with *3* as the input field value, selects all contacts with 0, 1, 2 or 3 children, but does not select those with 4 or more children.

    The **Equal to or less than** operator applies to [numeric](../Numeric/) and [date](../Date/) data types.

    See [Input field types](../InputFieldTypes/) for more about each input field.
