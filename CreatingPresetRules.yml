    # Creating preset rules

    You can create a preset rule when you are creating or editing [a custom demographic rule](../CreatingCustomDemographicRule/), [a custom digital messages rule](../CreatingCustomDigitalMessagesRule/), or [a custom purchases rule](../CreatingCustomPurchasesRule/), or you are editing an existing favorite or preset.

    Do the following:

    1. Create or edit the rule as required.

    2. When you are finished, click **Save as preset**, before you click **Add** or **Save** to apply the rule to the segment.

    **Note:**

    If you click **Add** or **Save** before you click **Save as preset**, the rule is saved and relevant page closes. If this happens, you will need to re-open the rule to save it as a preset.

    You need the appropriate permissions to be able to create preset rules.
