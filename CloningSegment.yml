    # Cloning a segment

    ![Segments list view](/images/images/en/guide/MySegment.png)

    **The Segments list view**

    **Note:**

    See [Using data types, input fields and operators](../InputBoxOperators/) for more about the fields and operators that are available in the UI, and [UI icons](../UIIcons/) for a description of each icon.

    To clone a segment, do the following:

    1. Click the **Segments** tab.

      The **My segments** page displays.

    2. Locate the required segment using the **Segments list**.

    3. Click the circular **Clone** icon, positioned towards the right of the segment entry in the table. See [UI icons](../UIIcons/) for more details.

      The **New segment** page displays and the system automatically generates a segment name, consisting of the words **Copy of** and the current segment name. See [Creating new segments](../CreatingNewSegments/) for more about the **New segment** page.

    4. Select the system generated name and enter one of your choice.

      Ensure that the name you use is unique, descriptive of the segment, and can easily be recognized by yourself and others in the future.

    5. Complete the steps given in the following pages, according to how you want to change the cloned segment:

      - [Modifying an existing segment rule](../ModifyingExistingSegmentRule/)
      - [Deleting an existing segment rule](../DeletingExistingSegmentRule/)
      - [Adding a new segment rule](../AddingNewSegmentRule/)
      - [Modifying the interaction condition between segment rules](../ModifyingInteractionCondition/)

    6. When you have finished changing the cloned segment, click **Save**, to apply your changes.

    The cloned segment is updated and you are returned to the **My segments** page.

    **IMPORTANT:**

    If you do not click **Save** all changes are discarded and the cloned segment remains unchanged.
