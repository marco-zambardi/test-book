    # Reports and dashboard analysis

    ## Reports

    Contactplan includes a reporting function that provides a range of useful information about plans, such as:

    - The author
    - The creation date
    - The target run date
    - The target segment
    - The number of contacts selected

    If a plan is processed using Contactsend, a report also contains detailed performance feedback, such as:

    - The number of emails delivered
    - The number of emails opened
    - The number of clicks that have taken place

    See [Managing reports](../ManagingReports/) for more about accessing reports.

    ## Dashboards

    Dashboards provide graphic feedback about the most important demographic and event-based factors related to a given segment or the whole database, such as:

    - Age and gender distribution
    - Geo-distribution
    - Spending levels

    and similar.

    See [Managing dashboards](../ManagingDashboards/) for more about accessing and using dashboards.
