    # Changing the segment name

    To change the segment name:

    1. Select the name of the segment on the **Edit segment** page and change as required.

    2. Carry out other edit actions as required.

      See [Editing a segment](../EditingSegment/) for other editing options.

    **IMPORTANT:**

    If you do not click **Save** once you have finished editing the segment, all edits are discarded and the segment remains unchanged.
