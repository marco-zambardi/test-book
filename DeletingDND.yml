    **The Edit DND policy page**

    To delete a DND policy, do the following:

    1. Click the **Settings** tab, in the **Control bar**

      The **Segmentation settings** page displays.

    2. Click the **Do Not Disturb Policy** tab.

      The **Do Not Disturb policy** page displays.

    3. Locate and click the name of the relevant policy

      The **Edit DND policy** page displays.

      **Note:**

      Ensure that you do not click the radio button in the **Default** column.

    4. Click **Delete**.

      A **Confirm deletion** page displays.

    5. Click **Confirm** to delete the policy, or **Cancel** to abort the process.

      The policy is deleted and you are returned to the **DND policy management** page.

    **IMPORTANT:**

    Deleting a DND policy cannot be reversed.

    **Note:**

    If you delete a DND policy, it still continues to be used by any plans to which it has already been applied. If any such plan is later edited, a warning, stating that the DND policy has been deleted, is displayed. You can, however, still continue to use the deleted DND policy with the relevant plan, provided that you do not select a new one and save the plan.

    ## Exiting the Edit DND policy page

    You can exit the **Edit DND policy** page at any time, without deleting the policy, by clicking the **X** icon, positioned in the top-right corner of the page.
