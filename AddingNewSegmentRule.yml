    # Adding a new segment rule

    To add a new rule:

    1. Depending upon the rule that you want to add to the segment, click one of the following:

      - [Create a demographic rule](../CreatingDemographicRule/)
      - [Create a digital messages rule](../CreatingDigitalMessagesRule/)
      - [Create a purchases rule](../CreatingPurchasesRule/)

    and follow the instructions on the relevant page of this guide to add a rule for that category.

      When the rule is created:

      - You are returned to the **Edit segment** page
      - The rule is added to the **Rule list** area of the **Summary panel**, which is displayed to the right of the **Edit segment** page.

        See [Segment Summary panel](../SegmentSummaryPanel/) for more about the **Summary panel**.

    2. Correlate the new rule with the previous rule, if available and required.

      See [Creating a segment by correlating rules](../CreatingCorrelationSegment/) for more details.

    3. Check the **interaction conditions** between the rules and change as required, to ensure that they are valid for the existing rule/s and the new rule.

      See [Modifying the interaction condition between segment rules](../ModifyingInteractionCondition/) and [Segment Summary panel](../SegmentSummaryPanel/) for more about **interaction conditions**.

    4. Create other rules, or carry out other edit actions as required.

      See [Editing a segment](../EditingSegment/) for other editing options.

    **IMPORTANT:**

    If you do not click **Save** once you have finished editing the segment, all edits are discarded and the segment remains unchanged.
