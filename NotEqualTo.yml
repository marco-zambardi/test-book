    # Not equal to operator type

    The **Not equal to** operator is used to select all those contacts that do not match the value entered in the condition input field.

    **Example:**

    Setting the *First Name* condition to **Not equal to**, with *Sam* as the input field value, selects all those contacts whose first name is not *Sam*. Contacts whose first name is, for example, Samantha, Sammy, Paul, John and so on, are selected.

    The **Not equal to** operator applies to [string](../String/), [numeric](../Numeric/) and [date](../Date/) data types.

    **Note:**

    The **Not equal to** operator can also be applied when multiple values are set for a given attribute. It is used to select those contacts for which the relevant attribute value does not match any of those entered in the condition input field. In this instance, the **Not equal to** operator applies to [string](../String/) data types only.

    See [Input field types](../InputFieldTypes/) for more about each input field.
