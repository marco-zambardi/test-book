    # Is not null operator type

    The **Is not null** operator is used to select all those contacts that have anything but no value entered for the relevant attribute. This means all contacts that have any value for the relevant attribute in the database are selected. If this operator is selected, no value is required in condition input field.

    **Example:**

    Setting the *Gender* condition to **Is not null**, selects all those contacts that have any gender information in the database.

    The **Is not null** operator applies to [string](../String/), [numeric](../Numeric/) and [date](../Date/) data types.

    See [Input field types](../InputFieldTypes/) for more about each input field.
