    ## A

    ### Analytical query

    A special kind of query that can be applied to behavioral data. An analytical query selects contacts whose behavior matches a defined parameter, such as equal to, greater than, or less than/greater than a specific cutoff threshold.

    **Example:**

    All those contacts who have bought yellow bags on more than 10% of the occasions when they bought something.

    See [Analytical queries](../AnalyticalQueries/) for more details.

    <a name="C"></a>

    ## C

    ### Condition

    Selection criteria used to define a rule and as a result, a segment. A condition is a basic expression in the form *attribute*, *operator*, *value*, *value2 (optional)*.

    **Example:**

    Last name (*attribute*), Equal to (*operator*), Smith (*value*)

    Multiple conditions may used to define a rule, and can be combined using logical operators such as AND or OR.

    See [Understanding segmentation](../UnderstandingSegmentation/) for more details.

    ### Consumer

    A target platform that is external to Contactplan, which uses the list of contacts associated with a plan, and may also carry out the plan itself. To deploy a consumer, it always needs to be associated with a plan, but plans can have zero, one or more consumers. Each consumer uses the list of contacts according to its assigned role.

    See [Understanding plans](../UnderstandingPlans/) for more details.

    ### Contact

    A single entry in the customer database. A contact must include at least an email address, a telephone number, an IP address, or a similar communication method. Contacts that satisfy the filter for a particular segment are regarded as being part of that segment.

    ### Correlation-based query

    A special kind of query that can be applied to behavioral data. A correlation-based query enables a relationship to be established between two different events, which take place during a given period of time.

    **Example:**

    All those contacts who reserved a hotel room within seven days of having booked a flight.

    See [Correlation-based queries](../CorrelationBasedQueries/) for more details.

    ## D

    ### Digital Message events

    All the events recorded in the database that relate to how a contact reacts to the digital communications they have received. The communications can be email or SMS messages, or Push notifications. The event types associated with Digital Messages are:

    - Delivered

      A particular communication has been sent to the contact.

    - Views

      A particular communication has been opened by the contact.

    - Clicks

      A link in a particular communication has been clicked by the contact

    See [Creating a custom digital messages rule](../CreatingCustomDigitalMessagesRule/) and [Time frame conditions](../TimeFrameConditions/) for more details.

    ### DND policy

    Defines the maximum number of communications that can be sent to a contact in a given time frame.

    See [Managing DND policy settings](../ManagingDND/) for more details.

    <a name="E"></a>

    <br/>
    <br/>

    ## E

    ### Event

    Data related to the behavior of customers. An event is associated with the precise moment in time that it took place, and a particular contact. They are organized in categories and types, and may have specific properties.

    See [Time frame conditions](../TimeFrameConditions/) for more details.

    <a name="F"></a>

    <br/>

    ## F

    ### Filter

    A query or a combination of queries that are applied to the customer database. A filter is defined by the segment rule or rules, which in turn may consist of multiple conditions that are applied to demographic or behavioral information.

    See [Understanding segmentation](../UnderstandingSegmentation/) for more details.

    <a name="G"></a>

    <br/>

    ## G

    <a name="H"></a>

    <br/>

    ## H

    <a name="I"></a>

    <br/>
    <br/>

    ## I

    ### Interaction condition

    The logical operator that is applied to combine two rules. For example, AND, OR, or EXCEPT.

    See [Combining segment rules](../CombiningSegmentRules/) for more details.


    <a name="J"></a>

    ## L

    ### List

    A set of contacts that make up a segment. All selected contacts satisfy the filter associated with the segment, at the time that the list is created. The same segment may result in a different list of contacts, if applied at another point in time.

    When the segment is used within a plan, the list of contacts may be reduced after any optional Do Not Disturb (DND) policy associated with the plan, has been applied.

    <a name="M"></a>

    <br/>
    <br/>

    ## M

    ### Model

    Metadata related to contact and event entities. A model specifies the label, name, range, acceptable values, allowed operators and similar, for each entity attribute.


    <a name="N"></a>

    <br/>
    <br/>

    ## N


    <a name="O"></a>

    <br/>

    ## O

    <a name="P"></a>

    <br/>
    <br/>

    ## P

    ### Plans

    A defined way of using the segment contact list, optionally with an external target platform (consumer) which may be Contactsend. As a minimum, a plan consists of:

    - The delivery date, time and time zone
    - The target segment

    Available options include:

    - A DND policy
    - A plan consumer
    - Test email addresses

    See [Understanding plans](../UnderstandingPlans/) for more details.

    ### Purchase events

    All those events related to purchases made by a contact, either online or in store. The event types associated with purchases are:

    - Have purchased

      Contacts that have made a purchase.

    - Have not purchased

      Contacts that have not made a purchase.

    - Have an order line

      Contacts that have made a purchase.

    - Do not have an order line

      Contacts that have not made a purchase.

    See [Creating a custom purchases rule](../CreatingCustomPurchasesRule/) and [Time frame conditions](../TimeFrameConditions/) for more details.

    ## Q

    <a name="R"></a>

    <br/>
    <br/>

    ## R

    ### Rule

    A database filter element. A rule is a query that is made up of one or more conditions that are applied to:

    - Demographic data
    - Behavioral data (events) regarding digital messages that have previously been sent
    - Behavioral data (events) regarding online and offline purchases

    A single rule cannot include conditions that relate to different data types, for example, demographic and purchases-related data, or digital messages and purchases data.

    Rules can be combined using logical operators or interaction conditions, such as AND, OR, or EXCEPT.

    See [Understanding segmentation](../UnderstandingSegmentation/) for more details.


    <a name="S"></a>

    <br/>
    <br/>

    ## S

    ### Segment

    The result of a filter being applied to a database. A segment identifies a group of contacts that are included in the database, who satisfy the filter. The group of contacts identified by a segment may change over time.

    A segment can also be created by combining existing segments. Once a segment has been saved, it can be opened, edited or deleted. A segment is identified by a UUID and a unique name.

    See [Understanding segmentation](../UnderstandingSegmentation/) for more details.
