    # Drill down field type

    This special input field type may be used when there are attributes that are hierarchically related in a parent-child relationship. For example, when the possible values of one attribute depend upon the value selected for the parent attribute. Location-related attributes, such as **Continent**, **Country**, **Region** and **City** are typical examples of where this type of input field may be used.

    ## Use

    The UI displays a selectable drop-down list showing the available values for the first-level attribute. A range of values are displayed and the remainder can be accessed by scrolling up or down the list. Do the following:

    1. Click a first-level attribute value to select it.

      A new drop-down list opens, which displays the appropriate second-level attribute values that are associated with the selected first-level value.

    2. Click a second-level attribute value to select it.

      A new drop-down list opens, which displays the appropriate third-level attribute values that are associated with the selected second-level value.

    3. Repeat the above steps until attribute values have been selected for all levels of the drill down hierarchy.

    Only one value can be selected at a time for each level, in this type of input field.

    **Example:**

    For a geographic location-related condition:

    - The first-level drop-down list displays the continents: North America, South America, Africa, Europe, Asia and Australia
    - If Europe is selected, a second-level drop-down list displays the countries: Spain, France, Italy, Portugal, Germany, Netherlands, Sweden, Norway and so on
    - If Italy is selected, a third-level drop-down list displays the regions: Piedmont, Lombardy, Tuscany and so on
    - If Lombardy is selected, a fourth-level drop-down list displays the cities: Milan, Bergamo, Monza and so on
