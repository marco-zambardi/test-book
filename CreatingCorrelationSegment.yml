    # Creating a segment by correlating rules

    A segment can consist of, or include, two consecutive event-type rules, which are then correlated to identify contacts who carried out a particular action, then did something else within a defined time frame.

    **Example:**

    Contacts who bought a handbag more than three days after clicking an email link to the 2015 bag collection. See [Correlation-based queries](../CorrelationBasedQueries/) for more examples.

    Digital messages rules, purchases rules, or a combination of both, can be used to create the correlation, while the segment can be further quantified, using all three types of rule.

    ## Correlating rules to create a segment

    Do the following:

    1. Decide upon:

      - The rules that you want to correlate

      - The order in which they need to be created to achieve the desired result

        The order cannot be changed later.

      - Their relationship with any other rules that are to make up the segment

        For example, you may wish to use a demographic rule before the correlated rules.

    2. Follow the steps given in [Creating new segments](../CreatingNewSegments/), [Creating a custom digital messages rule](../CreatingCustomDigitalMessagesRule/) or [Creating a custom purchases rule](../CreatingCustomPurchasesRule/) to create the first rule.

    3. Repeat the above step to create your second rule.

    When you have created two rules that can be correlated, the [Segment Summary panel](../SegmentSummaryPanel/) includes a **Correlate events** icon, positioned to the left of the **interaction condition** controls.

    4. Click the **Correlate events** icon.

      The **Create correlation** page displays.

    5. Choose to correlate the first or the last time contacts carried out each action, as follows:

      - Under **Event 1**, click the downwards pointing arrow, positioned to the right of the box, and select to use either the **First** or **Last** occurrence of the event defined by rule 1

      - Under **Event 2**, click the downwards pointing arrow, positioned to the right of the box, and select to use either the **First** or **Last** occurrence of the event defined by rule 2

    6. Under **Time interval**, define the time period that is to be applied to the correlation, as follows:

      - Click the downwards pointing arrow to the right of the first box, and select the appropriate operator, for example, **Greater than**, from the drop-down list

        See [Operator types](../OperatorTypes/) for more about operators.

      - Enter the required number of days in the second box

    7. Click **Confirm** to apply the correlation.

      The **Create correlation** page closes and the **Segment summary** panel changes to display the correlation.
