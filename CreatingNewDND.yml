    To create a new DND policy, do the following:

    1. Click the **Settings** tab, in the **Control bar**

      The **Segmentation settings** page displays.

    2. Click the **Do Not Disturb Policy** tab.

      The **DND policy management** page displays.

    3. Click **Create new DND policy**

      The **Create new DND policy** page displays.

    4. Enter a name of your choice for the new policy, in the first text box.

      Ensure that the name you use is unique, descriptive of the policy, and can easily be recognized by yourself and others in the future.

    5. Under **Allowed sending: max:**

      - Enter the appropriate numeric value in the first box
      - Click the downwards pointing arrow to the right of the second box, and select the appropriate time measurement from the drop-down list, for example, **day**

    6. If you want to add a further rule to the policy, select the **Add rule** check box.

      The conditional control boxes for a second rule display.

    7.  Under **and max**, do the following:

      - Enter the appropriate numeric value in the first box
      - Click the downwards pointing arrow to the right of the second box, and select the appropriate time measurement from the drop-down list, for example, **month**

    8. When the DND policy rules are defined as intended, click **Save**.

      You are returned to the **DND policy management** page and the new policy is added to the list.

    **Note:**

    Currently, no semantic check is carried out by the system on the DND policy. You must ensure that the policy rules are meaningful.

    ## Exiting the New DND policy page

    You can exit the **Create new DND policy** page at any time, without creating a new policy, by clicking the **X** icon, positioned in the top-right corner of the page.
