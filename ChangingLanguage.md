# Changing the UI display language

To change the UI display language, access your account setting area by clicking on your account name: the sidebar with your account setting will be displayed.

In the upper left corner, the current selected language is shown, e.g. EN for english; clicking on the arrow icon, displays all the available languages for the User Interface.

Select the desired languanges, e.g. IT, and the User Interface reloads the current page with the selected language.
