    # Combining conditions within a rule

    Conditions within a rule are combined by applying either the **ALL** or the **ANY** matching option.

    - **ALL**

      If the **ALL** option is applied, only those contacts that match all of the conditions that make up the rule are selected. The result is similar to applying an AND logical operator.

    - **ANY**

      If the **ANY** option is applied, any contacts that match at least one of the conditions that make up the rule are selected. The result is similar to applying an OR logical operator.
