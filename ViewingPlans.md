# Viewing plans

To access the **Plans management** page and view all currently available plans:

- Click the **Plans** tab, in the **Control bar**, if not already selected  
  The default **Plans list** view of the **My plans** page displays, showing all currently available plans.  
- Click the **Calendar** icon, positioned to the right of the page, to change to the **Plans calendar** view  

See [Getting started and navigating the UI](NavigatingUI) for more about UI page views and icons.

## Plans list view

*Insert Plans list view screen shot...*  

The **Plans list** view is a table that is sorted in month order, starting with the current month. It displays the plan names, the date they are to be run and the user who created the relevant plan.  

The **Plans list** view provides four predefined filters:  

- **All**  
- **Ready**  
- **Draft**  
- **Archived**  

Click the relevant filter to see only the saved plans in that category.  

See [Plan details](PlanDetails) for more about **Ready**, **Draft** and **Archived** plans.  

## Plans calendar view

*Insert Plans calendar view screen shot...*  

The default **Plans calendar** view displays plans on a monthly calendar page, starting with the current month. The current date is highlighted in light gray.  

Plans are shown on the day that they are to be run, together with the appropriate 12 hour clock-based time, for example, 6:29a or 4:38p (**a** denotes am, **p** means pm). The plans are highlighted as follows:  

- **Blue**: The plan is ready  
- **Dark gray**: The plan is a draft  
- **Gray**: The plan has been run and is archived  
  
Click the left or right facing arrow heads to navigate to the preceding or forthcoming months. If the displayed page is a month other than the current one, you can navigate back to the current date by clicking the **Today** button.  

### Displaying different calendar views  

Click the **Day**, **Week** or **Month** button, positioned to the right of the **Plans calendar** view to display the appropriate alternative calendar view.  

### Returning to the Plans list view  

Click the **List** icon, positioned to the right of the page, to change to the **Plans list** view.  

**Note:**
If you navigate away from the **Plans** tab and then return, the **Plans list** view is displayed.  

## Viewing a plan

Regardless of whether you are using the **Plans list** view or the **Plans calendar** view, you can display the details of a particular plan by clicking its name. See [Plan details](PlanDetails) for more about the information that is displayed on an individual plan page.  

**Note:**
When the delivery date and time for a ready plan has passed, it is archived and it can no longer be edited.
