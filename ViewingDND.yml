    # Viewing DND policies

    ![DND policy page](/images/images/en/guide/DNDSettings.png)

    **The Do Not Disturb policy management page**

    To access the **DND policy management** page and view all currently available policies:

    - Click the **Settings** tab, in the **Control bar**

      The **Segmentation settings** page displays.

    - Click the **Do Not Disturb Policy** tab

      The **Do Not Disturb policy** page displays.

    See [Getting started and navigating the UI](../NavigatingUI/) for more about UI page views and icons.

    ## Do Not Disturb policy page

    The **Do Not Disturb policy** page includes a table that is sorted in date order, starting with the oldest entry. It displays the DND policy names and their creation date. If a policy is set as the default, the appropriate radio button, to the left of the table, is highlighted. If a policy is global, the appropriate slider, to the right of the table, is set to the right.

    **Note:**

    A global DND policy is one that is applied to all of the plans in all of your available databases. This means, for example, that if a potential contact appears in more than one database, a global DND policy that is set for one message per day, will be applied to all instances of that contact, in all databases. The global policy will also override a DND policy that is set for an individual database, which perhaps allows three messages per day.

    If a DND policy is not set as global, it is only applied to the plans in the current database.

    ## Viewing a DND policy

    To view a DND policy, click the appropriate name in the table. The **Edit DND policy** page displays, with the relevant details.

    **Note:**

    Ensure that you do not click the radio button in the **Default** column.
