    # Understanding plans

    A plan includes all of the information that is required to use the contacts identified in a segment as, for example, the target audience for newsletters and other marketing activities.

    ## Plan components

    As a minimum, plans include the following information:

    - The target date, time and time zone to carry out the plan

    - The target segment to be used (contacts)

    - The consumer

      The platform, external to Contactplan, which is to receive the list of contacts.

    The following can also be defined in a plan:

    - Whether it is a single-shot or a recurring plan

    - The Do Not Disturb (DND) policy

      To manage the volume of messages sent to contacts

    - The number of contacts that should be included in the contact list

    - What action to take if the required number of contacts is not available in the appropriate segment

    ### Target audience

    The target audience of a plan is defined by:

    - The contacts selected by the segment

    - Any DND policy that is applied

      All contacts that have already reached the maximum number of communications allowed by the policy are removed.

    - The number of contacts selected in the **Set contacts number** field of the **Advanced options** section

      Defines whether to use **All** the contacts in the segment, an **Exact** number, or a **Range** between two limits that you specify

    ## Plan processing

    The resulting list of contacts is passed to the selected consumer for the plan to be run. The following consumers are available as standard:

    - A **Clab Filter Creator** plug-in

      Used to create a test filter and the actual filter in Contactsend.

    - A **Clab Campaign Creator** plug-in

      Used to create a campaign in Contactsend.

    - A **Consumer SFTP** plugin

      Saves the list of contacts to an external storage space, from where it can be retrieved manually, or automatically by another system.

    The Contactplan architecture has been designed so that a new plugin can be added, without a loss of service.
