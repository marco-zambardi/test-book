    3. Click **Delete**.

      The **Confirm deletion** page displays.

    4. Click **Confirm** to delete, or **Cancel** to abort.

      The segment is deleted and you are returned to the **My segments** page.

    **IMPORTANT:**

    Deleting a segment cannot be reversed.

    **Note:**

    If you delete a segment, it still continues to be used by any plans to which it has already been applied. If any such plan is later edited, a warning, stating that the segment has been deleted, is displayed. You can, however, still continue to use the deleted segment with the relevant plan, provided that you do not select a new one and save the plan.
