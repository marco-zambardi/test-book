    # Between operator type

    The **Between** operator defines a value range for a particular condition. It is used to select those contacts for which the relevant attribute has a value that falls within the range identified by the minimum and maximum condition input fields.

    **Example:**

    - Setting the *Date of birth* condition to **Between** with *01/01/1980* and *31/12/1989* as the input field values, selects all contacts born in the 1980s.
    - Setting the *Number of children* condition to **Between**, with *1* and *3* as the input field values, selects all contacts with 1, 2 or 3 children.

    The **Between** operator applies to [numeric](../Numeric/) and [date](../Date/) data types.

    See [Input field types](../InputFieldTypes/) for more about each input field.
