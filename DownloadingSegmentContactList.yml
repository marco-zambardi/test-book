    **Note**

    The segment contact list only includes the contact ID and email address. However, due to the sensitive nature of this information, only users with Admin permissions can download a list.

    To download a segment contact list, do the following:

    1. Click the **Segments** tab.

      The **My segments** page displays.

    2. Locate the required segment using the **Segments list** or **Segments cards** view.

    3. Click the required segment.

      The **Edit segment** page displays.

    4. Click the **Download list** icon, positioned at the bottom of the **Segment Summary** panel.

      An Explorer window displays.

      See [UI icons](../UIIcons/) for a description of each icon displayed in the UI.

    5. Navigate to where you want to store the file, and click **Save**

    6. The file is saved and the Explorer window closes.

      **Note:**

      Depending upon the browser you use and your browser settings, the file may be automatically saved in the download folder that is defined for your device.
