    # Managing dashboards

    Dashboards are available for the whole database, or individual segments. See [Reports and dashboard analysis](../ReportsAndDashboardAnalysis/) for a summary of the type of information that dashboards include.

    ## Using dashboards

    Dashboards are divided into individual panels, which are made up of charts, graphs and other graphical representations of the available data. The contents of a dashboard are determined by us during system configuration.

    ### Dashboard panel controls

    Towards the top right of each dashboard panel are a series of controls that enable you manage the displayed information. While the available controls vary according to the type of chart, you can, for example:

    - Save the relevant chart in PNG format
    - Save the relevant chart to a cloud location for later editing
    - Pan the displayed information
    - Zoom in or out
    - Autoscale the chart
    - Reset the axes
    - View additional information when you hover your mouse over a particular area of the chart

    **Example of the additional information that is displayed when hovering the mouse**

    A screen tip displays when you position your mouse over a particular control icon, which describes what it does.

    ## Accessing the database dashboard

    To display the dashboard for the whole database, click the **Dashboard** tab in the **Control bar**.
