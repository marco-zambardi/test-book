  Ensure that you do not click the radio button in the **Default** column.  
2. Click **Delete**.  
  A **Confirm deletion** page displays.

**IMPORTANT:**

**Note:**
If you delete a DND policy, it still continues to be used by any plans to which it has already been applied. If any such plan is later edited, a warning, stating that the DND policy has been deleted, is displayed. You can, however, still continue to use the deleted DND policy with the relevant plan, provided that you do not select a new one and save the plan. 

## Exiting the Edit DND policy page

You can exit the **Edit DND policy** page at any time, without deleting the policy, by clicking the **X** icon, positioned in the top-right corner of the page.
