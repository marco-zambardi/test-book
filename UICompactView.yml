    **The UI compact view**

    The **compact view** automatically displays when the browser window is not wide enough for the **normal view**.

    It includes:

    - The **Control bar**, including:

      - A **Management page** icon

        Located in the top left-hand corner of the page.

        Replaces the **Dashboard**, **Plans**, **Segments**, **Reports** and **Settings** tabs in the **normal view**. See [UI icons](../UIIcons/) for a description of each icon displayed in the UI.

          - Click to display a selectable list of management pages
          - Click the appropriate entry to navigate to the required management page
          - Click the **X** icon, located in the top right-hand corner of the page, to close the list of management pages

      - The **Contactplan** logo

        Click at any time, to return to the start page.

    - The appropriate management page

      - Selected using the **Management page** icon on the **Control bar**

        The **Plans** management page is the default.

    **Note:**

    The **compact view** does not include the **User information** panel.

    ## UI normal view

    The [UI normal view](../UINormalView/) displays the UI as it is generally intended to be used.

    ### Returning to the UI normal view from the compact view

    Enlarge the browser window as appropriate, to display the UI **normal view**.
