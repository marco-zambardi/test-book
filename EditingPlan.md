  The **My plans** page displays.  
2. Locate the required plan using the **Plans list** or the **Plans calendar** view.  
3. Click the required plan.  
  The **Edit plan** page displays.  
1. Edit the required fields as follows:  
  - **Date and time**:  
    - Do one of the following:  
      - Enter the new delivery date and time  
        or:  
      - Click the calendar icon to display the calendar and use its controls to change the date, then enter a time  
  - **Segment** and **Select DND policy** fields:

    - Make a new selection from the drop-down list, as required  
  - **Test list** > **Email** field:  
    - Edit list, as required  
  - **Consumers** > **Consumer** field:  
    - Click the downwards pointing arrow to the right of the box and select a different target platform, as required  
2. When you have finished editing the plan, click:  
  
  - **Save as draft**  
   or:  
  - **Save** to save the plan as **Ready**  
  
  to apply your changes.  
  See [Plan details](PlanDetails) for more about **Ready** and **Draft** plans.  

The plan is updated and you are returned to the **My plans** page.  

**Note:**
If a **Draft** plan is saved as **Ready** following an edit, the draft is removed from the **Plans list** and the **Plans calendar** view, and it is no longer available.  

If you delete a segment or a DND policy, it still continues to be used by any plans to which it has already been applied. If any such plan is edited, a warning, stating that the segment or the DND policy has been deleted, is displayed. You can, however, still continue to use the deleted segment or DND policy with the relevant plan, provided that you do not select a new one and save the plan.  

**IMPORTANT:**  
If you do not click **Save as draft** or **Save**, all edits are discarded and the plan remains unchanged.
