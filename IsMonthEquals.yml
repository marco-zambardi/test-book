    # Is month equals operator type

    The **Is month equals** operator is used to select dates with a month value that exactly matches the **MM** component of the date that is entered in the condition input field. All other date components are ignored.

    **Example:**

    Setting the *Date* condition of a **Birth date** field to **Is month equals**, and entering 12/12/1978 as the input field value, selects all those contacts whose birth month matches that value. In this instance, all contacts born in December are selected.

    The **Is month equals** operator applies to [date](../Date/) data types.

    See [Input field types](../InputFieldTypes/) for more about each input field.
