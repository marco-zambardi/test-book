To access the **Local settings** page and view the current settings:

  The **Sementation settings** page displays.   
- Click **Local settings** in the horizontal list of available views.  
  The **Local settings** page displays.  

## Changing local settings  

To change the first day of the week, or the timezone, do the following:

1. Click the downwards pointing arrow to the right of the box next to the **First day of the week** or the **Timezone** field, and select the appropriate entry, for example, **Sunday** or **UTC +03**, from the drop-down list.  
2. Click **Update**.
  The local settings are updated accordingly and applied automatically when you use other contactplan UI pages.
