    # Modifying the interaction condition between segment rules

    To modify the interaction condition between rules:

    1. In the **Summary panel**, positioned to the right of the **Edit segment** page, locate the two relevant consecutive rules in the list and select the appropriate **interaction condition**, from those listed in the area between the two rules:

      - **AND**

        Only the contacts that conform with both rules are included in the total contacts for segment.

      - **OR**

        The contacts that conform with either rule are included in the total contacts for segment.

      - **EXCEPT**

        The contacts that are defined by the second rule are removed from those identified by the first rule.

      See [Combining segment rules](../CombiningSegmentRules/) and [Segment Summary panel](../SegmentSummaryPanel/) for more details about **interaction conditions**.

    2. Carry out other edit actions as required.

      See [Editing a segment](../EditingSegment/) for other editing options.

    **IMPORTANT:**

    If you do not click **Save** once you have finished editing the segment, all edits are discarded and the segment remains unchanged.
