    # Like operator type

    The **Like** operator is used to select all those contacts for which the relevant attribute partially matches the value entered in the condition input field. This means that the operator implicitly uses wildcards to match the input field with the relevant attribute values in the database.

    **Example:**

    Setting the *First Name* condition to **Like**, with *Sam* as the input field value, selects all those contacts whose first name has *Sam* included anywhere in their name. Contacts whose first name is, for example, Sam, Samantha or Sammy are selected.

    The **Like** operator applies to [string](../String/) data types.

    See [Input field types](../InputFieldTypes/) for more about each input field.
