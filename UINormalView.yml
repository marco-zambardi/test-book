    **The UI normal view**

    The **normal view** displays the UI as it is generally intended to be used, with all controls and tabs readily available.

    It includes:

    - The **Control bar**, including:

      - The **Contactplan** logo

        - Click at any time, to return to the start page

      - The **Dashboard**, **Plans**, **Segments**, **Reports** and **Settings** tabs

        - Click the appropriate tab to navigate to the required management page

          The **Plans** management page is the default.

      - The **User information** panel

        Displays the name of the current user and the database that is being used.

        - Click the panel to display the **Settings** and **Sign out** buttons.

        - Click the **Settings** button to:

          - [Select a different database](../SelectingADatabase/), if available for your account
          - [Change the UI display language](../ChangingLanguage/)

        - Click the **Sign out** button to end the current session

    - The appropriate management page

      - Selected using the tabs on the **Control bar**

    See [UI icons](../UIIcons/) for a description of each icon displayed in the UI.
