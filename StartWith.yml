    # Start with operator type

    The **Start with** operator is used to select all those contacts that start with the value entered in the condition input field. This means that the operator implicitly uses wildcards to match the input field with the relevant attribute values in the database.

    The **Start with** operator is not case sensitive.

    **Example:**

    Setting the *First Name* condition to **Start with**, with *Sam* as the input field value, selects all those contacts whose first name starts with *Sam*. Contacts whose first name is, for example, Sam, Samantha or Sammy are selected.

    The **Start with** operator applies to [string](../String/) data types.

    See [Input field types](../InputFieldTypes/) for more about each input field.
