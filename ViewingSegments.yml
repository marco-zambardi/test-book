    # Viewing segments

    To access the **Segments management** page and view all currently available segments:

    - Click the **Segments** tab, in the **Control bar**

      The default [Segments list view](../SegmentsListView/) of the **My segments** page displays, showing all currently available segments.

    - Click the **Cards** icon, positioned to the right of the page, to change to the [Segments cards view](../SegmentsCardsView/)

    See [Getting started and navigating the UI](../NavigatingUI/) for more about UI page views and icons.
