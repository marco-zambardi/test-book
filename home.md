    # Introduction

    Contactplan provides a range of powerful, yet readily usable database segmentation and planning tools, which  enable you to:

    - Clearly identify a target audience from an existing database for use, for example, in multi-channel direct marketing programs
    - Apply a series of demographic and behavioral rules to finely tune your segmentation choices
    - Save defined segments for further analysis, or use in a forthcoming delivery
    - Plan and execute one-off or recurring deliveries, using either Contactsend or a third-party application
    - Send a test delivery to an audience of your choice
    - Optionally apply a Do Not Disturb (DND) policy as required
