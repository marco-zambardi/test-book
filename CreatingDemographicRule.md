# Creating a demographic rule

You have four options when creating a demographic rule:

- Use a preset rule without modifying it  
- Select a preset rule and fine tune it as required  
- Use a favorite rule  
  Favorite rules are presets that have been saved as you favorites.
- Create a custom rule  

To create a demographic rule:  

1. Click **Create demographic rule** on the **New segment** page  
  The **Create demographic rule** page displays, with **My favorite rules** highlighted and shown by default. All preset rules that have been defined as favorites are listed. If no favorite rule has been selected, a hint that shows how to choose a favorite displays.  
2. Do one of the following:  
  - Select a favorite  
  - Click **Preset rules**, choose a preset, click **Select** to display the rule, then click **Add** to apply the rule to the segment.  
  - Click **Preset rules**, choose a preset, click **Select** to display the rule, fine tune it as required, then click **Add** to apply the rule to the segment. See [Editing a segment](EditingSegment.md) for more details.  
  **Note:**  
  Remember to change the name of the rule if you want to differentiate it from the preset.  
  Preset rules cannot be edited in the same way as a custom rule. Only the pre-defined condition/s can be edited.  
  - Click **Create custom rule** then follow the instructions given in [Creating a custom demographic rule](CreatingCustomDemographicRule.md)  
  
  Each time you add a rule, you are returned to the **New segment** page.  
  To close the **Create demographic rule** page without adding a rule:  
  - Click the **X** icon, located in the top right-hand corner of the page  
   or:  
  - Click **Cancel**  
  
3. Repeat the above steps as often as required until you have created all of the demographic rules.  
  **IMPORTANT:**  
  Ensure that you create all rules, including other types of rule such as Digital messages rules and Purchases rules, in the correct order, so that you can apply the appropriate **interaction condition** between pairs of rules. See [Creating new segments](CreatingNewSegments.md) for more about interaction conditions between rules.  

## Managing your favorite preset rules  

To set a preset as a favorite:

- Click **Preset rules** and locate the relevant preset  
- Click the heart shaped icon to highlight it  
  The rule is added to your favorites list.  

To remove a preset from your favorites:  

- Click **My favorite rules** and locate the relevant preset  
- Click the heart shaped icon to remove the highlighting  
  Next time you open **My favorite rules**, the relevant preset no longer appears the list.
