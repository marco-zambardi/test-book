    # Modifying correlated rules

    Rules that are correlated cannot be modified directly. You must first remove the correlation to be able to edit a rule, then reapply the correlation once you are finished, if required.

    To remove a correlation and modify a rule, do the following:

    1. Click the **Segments** tab

      The **My segments** page displays.

    2. Locate the required segment using the **Segments list** or **Segments cards** view

    3. Click the required segment

      The **Edit segment** page displays.

    4. In the **Segment summary** panel, locate the **Correlation rule** box, displayed beneath the relevant rules,  and click the **Unlink events** icon

    **The Segment summary panel and the Correlation rule box, with the Unlink events icon highlighted**

      The correlation is removed.

    5. Select and edit the appropriate rule as required

      See [Modifying an existing segment rule](../ModifyingExistingSegmentRule/) for more details.

    6. When you have finished editing the rule, reapply the correlation, if required

      See [Creating a segment by correlating rules](../CreatingCorrelationSegment/) for more details.
