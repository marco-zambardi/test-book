    # Managing Do Not Disturb policy settings

    A Do Not Disturb (DND) policy is defined by creating one or more quantity and time-based delivery rules, which are applied to the contacts in the relevant segment when a plan is run. For example, allow a maximum of one delivery each day and up to five deliveries in a week.

    See [Managing segments](../ManagingSegments/) and [Managing plans](../ManagingPlans/) for more about segments and plans.
