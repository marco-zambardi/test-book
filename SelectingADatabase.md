# Selecting a database

*Insert normal view screen shot with User Information displayed...*  

To change the database that contactplan uses, do the following:  

1. In the UI **normal view**, click the **User Information** field, positioned to the top right of the view.  
  The **User Information** panel displays. This includes:  
  - The name of the current database, for example, Company Name 1, positioned below the user name  
  - A selectable field, which repeats the name of the current database, positioned below the user name and the two letter language code  
2. In the selectable field, click the downwards pointing arrow to the right of the name of the current database, and select the required database.  
  The database being used changes accordingly.  
3. Click the **User name** field to close the **User Information** panel.
