    # Understanding segmentation

    Contactplan enables you to create segments from the appropriate database, using the following data categories:

    - Demographic data
    - Behavioral data (events) regarding digital messages that have previously been sent
    - Behavioral data (events) regarding online and offline purchases

    The Contactplan architecture has been purpose-designed to be capable of handling any other kind of data-based event, simply by applying the appropriate system configuration.

    See [Time frame conditions](../TimeFrameConditions/) for more about events.

    ## Segments, rules and conditions

    Segments are identified by applying a filter to the database, which is determined by one or more user-defined rules. Each rule is composed of a set of conditions. Conditions are selection criteria that are combined to make up a rule, for example, a demographic rule, or a purchases rule, which is then applied to the relevant category of data.

    A segment can include two or more rules that are applied to the same category of data, such as two digital message rules, or to different categories.

    ## Special query types

    Contactplan provides a simple way to create a segment out of a complex set of conditions, without needing to write any code or a script. Contactplan supports the following kinds of special queries:

    - [Analytical queries](../AnalyticalQueries/)
    - [Correlation-based queries](../CorrelationBasedQueries/)

    See the *Contactplan Product Overview* for a detailed description of segments, rules, filters and query types.
