    # Is year equals operator type

    The **Is year equals** operator is used to select dates with a year value that exactly matches the **YYYY** component of the date that is entered in the condition input field. All other date components are ignored.

    **Example:**

    Setting the *Date* condition of a **Birth date** field to **Is year equals**, and entering 12/12/1978 as the input field value, selects all those contacts whose birth year matches that value. In this instance, all contacts born in 1978 are selected.

    The **Is year equals** operator applies to [date](../Date/) data types.

    See [Input field types](../InputFieldTypes/) for more about each input field.
