# Reports and dashboard analysis

## Reports  

Contactplan includes a reporting function that provides a range of useful information about plans, such as:  
- The author  
- The creation date  
- The target execution date  
- The target segment  
- The number of contacts selected  

If a plan is processed using the ContactLab platform, a report also contains detailed performance feedback, such as:  

- The number of emails delivered   
- The number of emails opened  
- The number of clicks  

## Dashboards  

Dashboards provide graphic-based feedback about the most important factors related to a given segment, or the whole database, such as:  

- Age distribution  
- Geo-distribution  
- Spending levels  
  and similar.
