# Managing segments

The filter that is used to identify a **Segment** from the selected database of potential contacts, is defined by creating and applying one or more rules. Three distinct types of rule are available:  

- Demographic rules  
  For example, age, location, gender and similar.  
- Digital message-related rules  
  For example, rules that identify when a link has been clicked, a message has been opened and similar.
- Purchase-related rules  
  For example, rules that identify when purchases have been made at a chosen location, are over a particular value, or are within a defined time frame and similar.  

Regardless of the rule type, however, they can only provide usable segmentation, if the relevant data is available in the database. Contactplan can only apply rules to the data that exists.  

See the *Contactplan Product Overview* for a detailed description of rules, filters and query types.
