# Introduction  

Contactplan provides a range of powerful, yet readily usable database segmentation and planning tools, which  enable you to:

- Clearly identify a target audience from an existing database, for use, for example, in multi-channel direct marketing programs  
- Apply a series of demographic and behavioral rules to finely tune your segmentation choices  
- Save defined segments for further analysis, or use in a forthcoming delivery  
- Plan and execute one-off or recurring deliveries, using either the ContactLab platform or a third-party application  
- Send a test delivery to an audience of your choice  
- Optionally apply a Do Not Disturb (DND) policy as required  

**Note:**
Not all page links in this draft version of the contactplan user guide are active. Active links appear as hyperlinks, such as [Managing segments](ManagingSegments). Inactive links display as text in square brackets, for example, [Managing users].
