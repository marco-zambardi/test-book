# Deleting a segment

To delete a segment, do the following:

1. Click the **Segments** tab.  
  The **My segments** page displays.  
2. Locate the required segment using the **Segments list** or **Segments cards** view.  
3. Click the required segment.  
  The **Edit segment** page displays.  
1. Click **Delete**.  
  The **Confirm deletion** page displays.  
1. Click **Confirm** to delete, or **Cancel** to abort.  
  The segment is deleted and you are returned to the **My segments** page.  

**IMPORTANT:**
Deleting a segment cannot be reversed.  

**Note:**
If you delete a segment, it still continues to be used by any plans to which it has already been applied. If any such plan is later edited, a warning, stating that the segment has been deleted, is displayed. You can, however, still continue to use the deleted segment with the relevant plan, provided that you do not select a new one and save the plan.
