# Managing plans

A **Plan** is created by defining: 

- The day, time and time zone of the delivery  
- The appropriate segment  
- The required DND policy, if any  
- A list of test email addresses, if required  
- The target platform for executing the plan  

Plans can be saved as a **draft** or as **ready**. See [Plan details](PlanDetails.md) and [Creating new plans](CreatingNewPlans.md) for more details. Plans that have been run are saved by the system as **archived**.
