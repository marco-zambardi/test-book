    # Using the UI

    The Contactplan UI is a very capable web-based graphical interface for creating and managing segments and plans. It is intuitive to use, and has been purpose-designed to provide each Contactplan user with just the right level of detail and functionality.

    Data specialists can work with each individual attribute of the relevant database, while marketing experts and company managers, for example, can mix and match presets from a query library to extract the applicable segment. Whatever the case, complex segmentation projects can be carried out without needing any SQL knowledge, or an understanding of any other coding language.

    Creating a new plan is as simple as following a step-by-step wizard to provide all the required information.

    See [Getting started and navigating the UI](../NavigatingUI/) for more about the UI.
