    # Less than operator type

    The **Less than** operator applies to attributes that can be ordered. It is used to select those contacts for which the relevant attribute has a value less than the one entered in the condition input field.

    **Example:**

    Setting the *Number of children* condition to **Less than**, with *3* as the input field value, selects all contacts with 0, 1 or 2 children, but does not select those with 3 or more children.

    The **Less than** operator applies to [numeric](../Numeric/) and [date](../Date/) data types.

    See [Input field types](../InputFieldTypes/) for more about each input field.
