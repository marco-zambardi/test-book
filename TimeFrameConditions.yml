    # Time frame conditions

    Behavioral data can also be referred to as events or actions, because each item of data occurs at a precise moment in time. When creating or editing an event rule, meaning a rule that is applied to behavioral data, you can choose whether the applicable conditions are applied to:

    - All the events, regardless of when they occurred

      or:

    - Only those events that happened in a given time frame

    This is know as a time frame condition.

    A time frame condition can be:

    - **Anytime**

      All events are taken into account.

    - **In the date range**

      Only events that occurred after a given date, before a given date, or between two dates are taken into account.

    - **In the last**

      Only events that occurred in the last **N** days, weeks, or months are taken into account.

    Time frame conditions cannot be applied to demographic rules, as the data is not made up of events.
