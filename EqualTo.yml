    # Equal to operator type

    The **Equal to** operator is used to select all those contacts that exactly match the value entered in the condition input field.

    **Example:**

    Setting the *First Name* condition to **Equal to**, with *Sam* as the input field value, selects all those contacts whose first name is exactly *Sam*. Contacts whose first name is, for example, Samantha or Sammy are not selected.

    The **Equal to** operator applies to [string](../String/), [numeric](../Numeric/) and [date](../Date/) data types.

    **Note:**

    The **Equal to** operator can also be applied when multiple values are set for a given attribute. It is used to select those contacts for which the relevant attribute has a value that exactly matches at least one of those entered in the condition input field. In this instance, the **Equal to** operator applies to [string](../String/) data types only.

    See [Input field types](../InputFieldTypes/) for more about each input field.
