    # Getting started and navigating the UI

    ![log in](/images/images/en/guide/LogOn.png)

    **The Contactlab log-in page**

    ## Starting the UI

    To start the UI, do the following:

    1. On the log-in page, select the appropriate language, enter your **Username** and **Password**, and click **SIGN IN**

      The start page displays, with the **Plans** tab selected.

    2. Click the **Dashboard**, **Segments**, **Reports** or **Settings** tab, as required

      See [Managing plans](../ManagingPlans/), [Managing dashboards](../ManagingDashboards/), [Managing segments](../ManagingSegments/), [Managing reports](../ManagingReports/) and [Managing settings](../ManagingSettings/) for more about each tab.

    ## Navigating the UI

    The Contactplan UI appearance may differ, according to the size of your browser window. There are two standard views:

    - [UI normal view](../UINormalView/)

      Displays the UI as it is generally intended to be used.

    - [UI compact view](../UICompactView/)

      Displays when the browser window is not wide enough for the **normal view**.

    ### UI icons

    See [UI icons](../UIIcons/) for a description of each icon displayed in the UI.
