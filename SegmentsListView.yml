    **The Segments list view**

    The **Segments list** view is a table that displays the segment names, their creation date and time, their creator and the total number of contacts for each available segment.

    See [Getting started and navigating the UI](../NavigatingUI/) and [UI icons](../UIIcons/) for more about UI page views and icons.

    The **Clone** icon, positioned towards the right of each row in the table, enables a copy of a segment to be made and edited as required. See [Cloning a segment](../CloningSegment/) for more details.

    ## Sorting the list

    The default list view displays the oldest segments first. To sort the list, for example, by the creation date and time, click the double-headed arrow, positioned to the right of the appropriate column.

    **Note:**

    If you navigate away from the **Segments** tab and then return, the default list view is displayed again.

    ## Total contacts

    The total number of contacts that are available by applying the rules for a particular segment, varies over time.

    To display the current total number of available contacts for a segment:

    - Click the appropriate circular **Reload** icon, positioned in the **Contacts** column

      The current total displays after a short delay, while the system applies the rules to the relevant database.

    ## Viewing the details of a segment

    Click the relevant segment name to display its details in the **Edit segment** page. See [Segment details](../SegmentDetails/) for more about the information that is displayed on an individual segment page.
