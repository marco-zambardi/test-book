    **The New segment page**

    **Note:**

    See [Understanding segmentation](../UnderstandingSegmentation/) for more about segments, and [Using data types, input fields and operators](../InputBoxOperators/) for more about the fields and operators that are available in the UI.

    The following describes how to create an entirely new segment. You can, however, also create a segment by combining existing segments. See [Creating a new segment from existing segments](../NewSegmentSegment/) for more details.

    To create a new segment, do the following:

    1. Click the **Segments** tab.

      The **My segments** page displays.

    2. Click **Create new segment**.

      The **New segment** page displays, and the system automatically generates a segment name, consisting of the words **New segment** and the current date.

    3. Select the system generated name and enter one of your choice.

      Ensure that the name you use is unique, descriptive of the segment, and can easily be recognized by yourself and others in the future.

    4. Depending upon the rule/s that you want to define for the segment, click one of the following:

      - [Create Demographic Rule](../CreatingDemographicRule/)
      - [Create Digital messages Rule](../CreatingDigitalMessagesRule/)
      - [Create Purchases Rule](../CreatingPurchasesRule/)

      and follow the instructions to add a rule for that category. See the *Contactplan Product Overview* for a detailed description of rules and query types.

      When a rule is created:

      - You are returned to the **New segment** page
      - The rule is added to the **Rule list** area of the **Summary panel**, which is displayed to the right of the **New segment** page.

        See [Segment Summary panel](../SegmentSummaryPanel/) for more about the **Summary panel**.

    5. Repeat **Step 4** and the rule creation instructions as often as required, to continue to add rules in any of the available categories.

      **IMPORTANT:**

      When you are creating more than one rule, you need to ensure that you define them in the correct order, so that you can apply the appropriate **interaction condition** between a pair of rules. See **Step 6**,  [Segment Summary panel](../SegmentSummaryPanel/) and [Combining segment rules](../CombiningSegmentRules/) for more about **interaction conditions**. The current release does not allow the order of rules in the **Rule list** to be changed, once they have been defined.

      **Note:**

      If you are creating, for example, a segment with a number of rules, it is advisable to save the segment when you have added one or two rules, then edit it to add further rules. See [Editing a segment](../EditingSegment/) for more details.

    6. When you have defined two or more rules, you need to determine how one rule in the **Rule list** interacts with the next rule. Do the following:

      - In the **Summary panel**, positioned to the right of the **New segment** page, locate two consecutive rules in the list and select the appropriate **interaction condition**, from those listed in the area between the two rules.

        See [Segment Summary panel](../SegmentSummaryPanel/) and [Combining segment rules](../CombiningSegmentRules/) for more about **interaction conditions**.

      **Note:**

      You can also correlate two event-type rules, such as a digital messages rule and a purchases rule. See [Creating a segment by correlating rules](../CreatingCorrelationSegment/) for more details.

    7. When the segment and the associated rules are defined as intended, click **Save** to store it, or **Back to segments list** to abort the process.

      You are returned to the **My segments** page and the new segment is added to the list.

    See [Example of creating a new segment](../ExampleNewSegment/) for more about the segment creation process.

    A new segment can also be created by cloning an existing segment, then editing it as required. See [Cloning a segment](../CloningSegment/) for more details.
