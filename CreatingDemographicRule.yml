    **The Create Demographic Rule page**

    You have five options when creating a demographic rule:

    - Use a preset rule without modifying it

    - Select a preset rule and fine tune it as required

    - Use a favorite rule without modifying it

      Favorite rules are presets that have been selected to become favorites. See [Managing favorite preset rules](../ManagingFavoritePresetRules/) for more details.

    - Select a favorite rule and fine tune it as required

    - Create a custom rule

    To create a demographic rule:

    1. Click **Create demographic rule** on the **New segment** page.

      The **Create Demographic rule** page displays, with **My favorite rules** highlighted and shown by default. All preset rules that have been defined as favorites are listed. If no favorite rule has been selected, a hint that shows how to choose a favorite displays.

    2. Do one of the following:

      - Select a favorite, click **Select** to display the rule, then click **Add** to apply the rule to the segment
      - Select a favorite, click **Select** to display the rule, fine tune it as required, then click **Add** to apply the rule to the segment
      - Click **Preset rules**, choose a preset, click **Select** to display the rule, then click **Add** to apply the rule to the segment
      - Click **Preset rules**, choose a preset, click **Select** to display the rule, fine tune it as required, then click **Add** to apply the rule to the segment

        See [Editing a segment](../EditingSegment/) for more details.

        **Note:**

        Remember to change the name of the rule if you want to differentiate it from the preset.

        Preset rules and favorite rules cannot be edited in the same way as a custom rule. Only the pre-defined condition/s can be changed.

      - Click **Create custom rule** then follow the instructions given in [Creating a custom demographic rule](../CreatingCustomDemographicRule/)

      Each time you add a rule, you are returned to the **New segment** page.

      To close the **Create demographic rule** page without adding a rule:

      - Click the **X** icon, located in the top right-hand corner of the page

        or:

      - Click **Cancel**

    3. Repeat the above steps as often as required until you have created all of the demographic rules.

      **IMPORTANT:**

      Ensure that you create all rules, including other types of rule such as Digital messages rules and Purchases rules, in the correct order, so that you can apply the appropriate **interaction condition** between pairs of rules. See [Creating new segments](../CreatingNewSegments/) and [Combining segment rules](../CombiningSegmentRules/) for more about interaction conditions between rules.

    See [Creating preset rules](../CreatingPresetRules/) for more about creating presets. See [Managing favorite preset rules](../ManagingFavoritePresetRules/) for more details about favorite preset rules.
