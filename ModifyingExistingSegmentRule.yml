    # Modifying an existing segment rule

    To modify an existing rule:

    1. Locate the appropriate rule in the **Rule list** area of the **Segment Summary panel**, which is displayed to the right of the **Edit segment** page, and click the associated pencil icon.

      See [Segment Summary panel](../SegmentSummaryPanel/) for more about the **Summary panel**.

      The rule conditions display.

      **Note:**

      If two rules are correlated, you must click the **Unlink events** icon to remove the correlation, before you can edit one or both of the rules. Once you have updated the rule/s, you can re-establish the correlation, by clicking the **Correlate events** icon. See [Modifying correlated rules](../ModifyingCorrelatedRules/) and [UI icons](../UIIcons/) for more details.

    2. Edit the rule as required.

    3. Click **Save** to update the rule.

    4. Check the **interaction conditions** between the rules to ensure that they are still valid.

      See [Modifying the interaction condition between segment rules](../ModifyingInteractionCondition/) and [Segment Summary panel](../SegmentSummaryPanel/) for more about **interaction conditions**.

    5. Select and edit other rules, or carry out other edit actions as required.

      See [Editing a segment](../EditingSegment/) for other editing options.

    **IMPORTANT:**

    If you do not click **Save** once you have finished editing the segment, all edits are discarded and the segment remains unchanged.
