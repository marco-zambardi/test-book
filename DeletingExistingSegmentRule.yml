    # Deleting an existing segment rule

    To delete an existing rule:

    1. Locate the appropriate rule in the **Rule list** area of the **Summary panel**, which is displayed to the right of the **Edit segment** page, and click the associated **Bin** icon

      See [Segment Summary panel](../SegmentSummaryPanel/) for more about the **Summary panel**.

      The rule is deleted. Deleting a rule cannot be reversed.

      **Note:**

      If two rules are correlated, you must click the **Unlink events** icon to remove the correlation, before you can delete one or both of the rules. See [Creating a segment by correlating rules](../CreatingCorrelationSegment/) and [UI icons](../UIIcons/) for more details.
      
    2. Check the **interaction conditions** between the remaining rules to ensure that they are still valid.

      See [Modifying the interaction condition between segment rules](../ModifyingInteractionCondition/) and [Segment Summary panel](../SegmentSummaryPanel/) for more about **interaction conditions**.

    3. Select and delete other rules, or carry out other edit actions as required.

      See [Editing a segment](../EditingSegment/) for other editing options.

    **IMPORTANT:**

    If you do not click **Save** once you have finished editing the segment, all edits are discarded and the segment remains unchanged.
