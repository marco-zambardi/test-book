    # Free text field type

    Free text input fields are used for all attributes that have several thousand different values stored in the database. Attributes such as **First name** or **Last name** are typical examples of this type of input field.

    ## Use

    The UI displays an editable text box containing the words *Type here*. Any required characters can be typed in the free text box, which are then used as the value for the condition. For example, for a **First name** attribute, type *John* to identify all contacts with that name.

    Only one value can be entered at a time, in this type of input field.

    ***Tip:***

    If you need to define multiple values for an attribute with a free text input field, do the following:

    1. Select the required attribute again from the list in the **Add condition** panel.

      A new condition for the appropriate attribute displays.

    2. Type the additional value for the attribute in the new free text box.

    3. Under **Match**, select **ALL** or **ANY** as required.

      See [Combining conditions within a rule](../CombiningConditionsInRule/) for more details.

    **Note:**

    Editable text boxes may be case-sensitive, depending upon the configuration settings that have been applied to your system.
