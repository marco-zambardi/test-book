    # Correlation-based queries

    A correlation-based query enables a relationship to be established between two different events, which take place during a given period of time.

    **Example:**

    - All those contacts that bought a yellow bag ***within 5 days from*** having opened the *'New yellow bags in store!'* newsletter

      or:

    - All those contacts that placed an order ***more than 30 days after*** having clicked on the link in the newsletter

    See [Creating a segment by correlating rules](../CreatingCorrelationSegment/) for more about correlation-based queries.
